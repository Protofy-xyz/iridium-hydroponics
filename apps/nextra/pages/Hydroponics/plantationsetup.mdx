# Plantation setup
Now that you have your setup ready and know some basic hydroponics, it's time to start your plantation.

## ‚Äãüå±‚Äã‚Äã Seed starting
<Steps>

### Prepare the sponges
<div>
Soak the sponges in water until fully saturated.
</div>

### Sow the seeds
<div>
Place 1 or 2 seeds in each sponge. Using two seeds increases germination chances. If both seeds germinate, remove the weaker seedling to allow the stronger one to thrive.
</div>
<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
 It's important to ensure the seed is well covered so that the emerging root doesn't push the seed out. If necessary, push the seed deeper or cover it with the sponge material to secure it in place.
</Callout>

### Keep them in a dark, warm place
<div>
Place the sponges with seeds inside a closed container or covered germination tray to maintain humidity. Make sure the sponges stay moist throughout the entire germination process.
</div>

### Introduce light
<div>
Once seedlings emerge, gradually expose them to light, starting with soft or indirect light, to avoid shock. If seedlings are left in the dark for too long, they may become leggy, stretching out in search of light, which can weaken their structure and hinder their development.
</div>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
The germination time for seeds can vary significantly depending on the type of plant. Also, not all seeds will germinate at the same rate. Give them enough time before determining viability.
</Callout>

### Transplant to hydroponic system
<div>
When seedlings are strong enough and have a couple of true leaves, carefully move them to the main hydroponic system.
</div>
</Steps>
 
## ‚Äãüö∞‚Äã‚Äã Filling the system
<Steps>
### Fill the reservoir
<div>
Fill your reservoir with the desired amount of [water](/hidroponicstips#-water-quality). This step establishes the water base for your hydroponic system.
</div>

### Activate the mini water pump
<div>
Turning on the mini water pump will circulate water throughout the system. Once circulation is achieved, you may notice the water level in the reservoir drops slightly. This is normal and accounts for the water now present in the system's tubing
</div>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
Check for Leaks! Especially important during the initial setup, make sure there is no water escaping from tube joints or connections. Ensure all components are securely fitted to prevent leaks. 
</Callout>

### Adjust the float-switch level
<div>
Position the sensor holder so that the float switch rests just atop the water surface. This allows for precise monitoring of the water level, facilitating accurate readings of EC and pH.
</div>

### Cover the reservoir
<div>
It's essential to shield the reservoir from light exposure. Light penetration encourages algae growth, which can compete with your plants for nutrients and oxygen, potentially clogging the system and leading to root issues. A light-proof cover also helps maintain water temperature and nutrient integrity.
</div>
</Steps>

## ‚Äã‚õΩ‚Äã‚Äã Nutrient pumping setup
<Steps>
### Prepare the containers
<div>
Fill the dosing containers with each nutrient solution, including pH+, pH-, and Products A, B, C, etc. according to your system's requirements.
</div>

### Ensure hose connections
<div>
Check that the hoses are correctly connected from the container caps to the peristaltic pumps. Secure connections are vital to prevent leaks and ensure accurate nutrient delivery.
</div>

### Purge the tubes
<div>
Before dosing can begin, it's essential to remove any air from the tubes. This step ensures that the liquid flows correctly through the tubes, allowing for precise dosing without the interference of air bubbles.
You can purge each tube by pressing the button on each relay until liquid is expelled from the outlet.
<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
Ensure that no liquid from the purging process spills into the reservoir. Such spillage can disrupt the EC and pH balance, potentially harming your plants. You can use a cup to catch the liquid expelled during the purging process.
</Callout>
</div>
</Steps>

## üç≤‚Äã‚Äã Preparing the nutrient solution
<Steps>
### Check measured EC and pH
<div>
Before adding any nutrients, measure the electrical conductivity (EC) and pH of your water. This gives you a baseline to understand how much the nutrients affect these levels.
</div>

### Add Nutrients
<div>
Gradually add your hydroponic nutrients following the recommended dosage on the product label or your hydroponic system's guidelines. Then, allow the solution to thoroughly mix with the overall water volume in the system. The mini water pump should help keep the solution well-mixed.
</div>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
Always mix nutrients directly into the water, never mix nutrient concentrates together before dilution, as this can cause precipitation and nutrient lockout.
</Callout>

### Re-measure EC and pH
<div>
After adding the nutrients and mixing the solution, measure the EC and pH levels again. The EC should have risen, indicating the presence of dissolved nutrients. Adjust the nutrient concentration if necessary to reach the desired EC level for your specific plants.
</div>

### Adjust the pH
<div>
Once the nutrient concentration is set, adjust the pH of the solution. Most hydroponic plants thrive in a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5. Use pH up or pH down solutions to adjust the pH level as needed.
</div>
<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
Always adjust pH after adding nutrients, as the addition of nutrients can significantly alter the pH level of your solution.
</Callout>

### Let the solution settle
<div>
Allow the solution to settle for a few hours or even overnight. This waiting period lets any reactions between the nutrients and water complete, and the pH stabilizes. Re-check and adjust the pH if it has shifted during this time.
</div>

### Monitor and adjust regularly
<div>
Regular monitoring and adjustment of the nutrient solution's EC and pH levels are essential throughout the growth cycle. This ensures your plants always have access to the nutrients they need in a form they can absorb.
</div>
</Steps>

## ü´ó‚Äã‚Äã Flushing
Flushing a hydroponic setup serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it removes excess nutrient salts, preventing nutrient imbalances and ensuring optimal plant growth. Secondly, it helps maintain the pH levels within the desired range, as excessive salts can affect pH stability. Lastly, flushing helps clean the growing medium and the entire system, preventing the accumulation of harmful bacteria or algae.

Conduct a flush every 4-6 weeks or as needed based on plant health and system performance. A regular flushing schedule can greatly contribute to the health and productivity of your hydroponic garden by ensuring a clean and balanced growing environment.

<Steps>

### Turn off the mini water pump
<div>
Turning it off protects it from running dry or pumping air, which can cause overheating and potentially damage the pump's internal components. Water pumps are designed to operate with liquid flow, which aids in cooling and lubricating the pump's moving parts. 
</div>

### Drain the reservoir
<div>
Drain all existing nutrient-diluted water from your reservoir. Ensure to remove as much liquid as possible to prevent mixing with the fresh water.
You can do so by turning on the flush pump.

You can also wipe the reservoir recipient in case there are residues on the walls and floor.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
If possible, you can also slightly tilt the tubes in order to empty most of the water in the system tubes
</Callout>
</div>

### Fill the reservoir
<div>
Fill your reservoir with fresh water.
You can do so by turning on the water supply pump.
</div>

### Run the clean water
<div>
Turn the mini water pump back on and allow the clean water to circulate through the system. This will help to dissolve any residual salts and nutrients.
</div>

###  Optional: repeat drain & refill
<div>
If necessary, you can consider repeating the drain and refill process for a more exhaustive cleanse. This step ensures the removal of any stubborn residues or build-up that may not have been fully cleared with the initial flush. It also helps to reset the system's nutrient baseline, making it easier to control and optimize plant nutrition.
</div>

###  Prepare the nutrient solution
<div>
Prepare a new fresh nutrient solution according to your plants' current needs and fill the reservoir. Adjust the pH as necessary.
You can follow up the same steps as here.
</div>

###  Resume normal operation
<div>
Monitor your plants closely for the next few days to ensure they respond well to the flush.
</div>
